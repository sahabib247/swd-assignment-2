        <div class="panel">
            <b>VAR:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Function-scoped variables, declared by 'var', are only visible inside the function in which they are declared. Global variables are those that are declared outside of any function.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>'var' variables are hoisted, which means that during compilation, the declaration is moved to the top of the function or global context. The initialization is still in effect, though.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>LET:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>'let'-declared variables are block-scoped, which means you may access them only inside the block (two curly brackets) in which they are specified.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Let variables are not hoisted in the same manner as var. The interpreter gets to the declaration before the variable is initialized, even though they are hoisted.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>CONST:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Variables that are declared with 'const' are also block-scoped.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>When using 'const' with objects or arrays, the reference is also a constant, but the properties or elements inside the object or array can still be modified.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

        <button class="accordion"><b>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>In JavaScript, 'null' and 'undefined' are special values that represent the absence of a meaningful value.</p>
            <b>NULL:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Null is typically used as an intentional absence of any object value.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It can be assigned to a variable to indicate that it has no meaningful value or that it has been explicitly set to nothing.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <b>UNDEFINED:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Variables which have not been initialized are automatically assigned to 'undefined'.</p>
                </li>

        <button class="accordion"><b>What do you mean by REST API?</b></button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>REST API stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It indicates that a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value.</p>
            <p>REST API provides a set of rules for building web services that are scalable, stateless, can easily be consumed by various clients, which makes it a popular choice for web development.</p>
